# Abstract Factory

![Abstract Factoriy](docs/images/abstract_factory.png)

## Intent

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Related Patterns

AbstractFactory classes are often implemented with **factory methods**, but they can also be implemented
using **Prototype**. A concrete factory is often a **Singleton**.
